a: 
    There are 8 trees.
b: 
    By replacing the NP rule to NP -> NP PP | Det N, the recursive-descent parser will be recursing infinitly. 
    The reason is that "NP PP" is prioritized over "Det N", the parser will keep tring "NP PP". However, the default sentence is starting with "Det N".
c: 
    By replacing the NP rule to NP -> Det N | NP PP, the recursive-descent parser works fine for the default sentence. 
    However, if we consider some general cases, this order change will not give an adequate solution sometimes. 
    The reason is that if the NP is not starting with Det, the praser will recurse infinitly.
